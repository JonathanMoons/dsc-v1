Context summary for future workspace sessions:

1. Goal
- Manage TrackerDSC2019SFTP DSC configuration for Azure Machine Configuration.
- Provide automation scripts to compile MOF, package Guest Configuration zip, deploy policy, validate locally, and debug.

2. Current assets (in dsc-v1-staging)
- ContosoMOFIssueNew.ps1: DSC v1 Script resource ensuring SQL Windows login exists/enabled. Uses PSDscResources and SqlServer module. Includes Get/Test/Set blocks with Invoke-Sqlcmd helper, references $using:SQLServiceUsername, Node defaults to localhost.
- CreateTrackerMOF.ps1: PowerShell 5.1 script (#requires), ensures PSDscResources 2.12.0.0 installed via helper, compiles MOF to out/.
- PackageTrackerConfig.ps1: PowerShell 7 script (#requires), ensures PSDscResources 2.12.0.0 and SqlServer (>=21.1.18256) installed, runs New-GuestConfigurationPackage, validates with Get-GuestConfigurationPackageComplianceStatus, optional Start-GuestConfigurationPackageRemediation when -RunLocalRemediation provided, produces artifacts/TrackerDSC2019SFTP-<version>.zip.
- DeployTrackerPolicy.ps1: PowerShell 7 script that installs Az/GuestConfiguration modules as needed, uploads the zip to storage, generates the policy JSON (New-GuestConfigurationPolicy), publishes it, and assigns it with a system-assigned identity.
- ValidateTrackerConfig.ps1: Windows PowerShell 5.1 helper that installs PSDscResources + SqlServer modules, runs Test-DscConfiguration against out/<NodeName>.mof, and optionally remediates locally.
- DebugTrackerStatus.ps1: PowerShell 7 diagnostic script that queries Get-AzPolicyState, Search-AzGraph, and Get-AzGuestConfigurationAssignment for compliance insight.
- README.md: Documents prerequisites, exact commands for steps, troubleshooting tips (gc.exe blocking, module installs, logs).

3. Outstanding work
- None. Focus on iterating the configuration/policy as requirements evolve.

4. Known issues / environment notes
- Company security tools may block GuestConfiguration gc.exe; local compliance tests might need alternate machine or allow-list.
- Module versions matter: PSDscResources 2.12.0.0 embedded; SqlServer module required on testing machine.
- Packaging validation log locations: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\GuestConfiguration\<version>\gcworker\logs and %ProgramData%\GuestConfig.

5. Usage reminders
- Run CreateTrackerMOF.ps1 in Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Run PackageTrackerConfig.ps1 in pwsh 7+, use -Force to overwrite existing zip, -RunLocalRemediation only when AssignmentType=AuditAndSet.
- After package creation, run DeployTrackerPolicy.ps1 to publish + assign, then DebugTrackerStatus.ps1 to monitor.
